This is very uncool, but in case you don't have a GAMS license and you want to contribute to the project, I uploaded the 25.0.3 version and a license @ https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E-1Dor5dkijAPRNmPA22zGiOk_JR697f

Of course, if you use GAMS for anything other then testing and research you or your company should definitely buy it.
